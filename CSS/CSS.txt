CSS 1
CSS 2
CSS 2.1
CSS 3

We Can Write CSS in 3 Types:
----------------------------
1.Inline CSS 
2.Internal CSS
3.External CSS

Among the all 3 CSS Styling Method The Inline CSS will be given a Highest Priority.

Top to Bottom Approach:
-----------------------
<!-- link:css -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Where ever You see the link:css Property First that will be There.
Where ever you see the link:css Property Last that will be Over Writing the Property.
Which of the link:css Property was Applied Last That will take Over the Power.

This will be also for all 2 types of CSS, which ever will be the last that will be have the Power to Reflect on the Live Server.

!important:
-----------
<style>
        h1 {
          font-size: 200px;
          color: #6e1cbb !important;
        }
    </style>
i)We can also use !important Property of CSS to higher or Top Most Priotize For The Color to Reflect on Live Server.
ii)It's not a Great way to use it because it Messes Up CSSin Long Run, But You can actually Make it as higher Priority, But Don't do this in a General because it's not a good Idea, We want to get the Top to Bottom Flow .

Basic Anatomy and Nomenclature:
