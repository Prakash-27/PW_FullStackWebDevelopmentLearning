The Node.js architecture offers several advantages,
     making the server-side platform stand out among every other server-side language.
     Moreover, the Node.js-developed server is always faster and more responsive compared 
     to the one created using the other server development technologies.

    Event loop: A key component of Node.js architecture, the event loop is an indefinite 
                loop that processes requests from the event queue.
    Event queue: A waiting list for requests that are received.
    
    Thread pool: Each server has a fixed number of threads, with one thread assigned to each complex request.
    
    External resources: These include databases, file systems, and compute.
    
    V8 engine: A fundamental part of Node.js architecture, the V8 engine converts JavaScript code to machine code that 
               can be understood by machines.
               
    Asynchronous architecture: Allows Node.js to run multiple operations at once by performing non-blocking operations.
    
    I/O model: Involves reading and writing files to disk, interacting with the database, and HTTP requests.
