1.Encapsulation: It involves bundling data and related behaviours into objects, and providing methods to interact with the object.

2.Inheritance: It allows classes to inherit properties and behaviours from other classes, forming a hierarchy of classes. Inherited features can be extended or overridden in derived classes.

3.Polymorphism: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. Polymorphism allows methods to be defined in a general way and overridden in specific classes to provide different implementations.

eg: 2+2 = 4
    "2"+"2" = 22

4.Abstraction: It focuses on representing essential features of objects while hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure for related classes.
